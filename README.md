# Laptop-Price-Predictor-

The purpose of this project was to predict laptop prices based on 12 different attributes using a variety of Machine Learning algorithms. 
A preliminary data cleansing process was carried out, such as data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering, before the models were 
developed. The random forest algorithm provided accurate price predictions which will allow consumers to find a laptop that meets 
their specific needs quickly.
1. Machine Learning Algorithms and accuracy obtained: Linear Regression (79.19%), K-Neighbors Regressor (71.33%), Random Forest 
algorithm (87.55%)
2. Programming Language: Python
3. Tools and Methodologies Used: Data Pre-processing and Cleaning, Data Transformation, Jupyter Noteboo
